# Database query built from user-controlled sources
If a database query (such as a SQL or NoSQL query) is built from user-provided data without sufficient sanitization, a malicious user may be able to run malicious database queries.


## Recommendation
Most database connector libraries offer a way of safely embedding untrusted data into a query by means of query parameters or prepared statements.

For NoSQL queries, make use of an operator like MongoDB's `$eq` to ensure that untrusted data is interpreted as a literal value and not as a query object. Alternatively, check that the untrusted data is a literal value and not a query object before using it in a query.

For SQL queries, use query parameters or prepared statements to embed untrusted data into the query string, or use a library like `sqlstring` to escape untrusted data.


## Example
In the following example, assume the function `handler` is an HTTP request handler in a web application, whose parameter `req` contains the request object.

The handler constructs an SQL query string from user input and executes it as a database query using the `pg` library. The user input may contain quote characters, so this code is vulnerable to a SQL injection attack.


```javascript
const app = require("express")(),
      pg = require("pg"),
      pool = new pg.Pool(config);

app.get("search", function handler(req, res) {
  // BAD: the category might have SQL special characters in it
  var query1 =
    "SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY='" +
    req.params.category +
    "' ORDER BY PRICE";
  pool.query(query1, [], function(err, results) {
    // process results
  });
});

```
To fix this vulnerability, we can use query parameters to embed the user input into the query string. In this example, we use the API offered by the `pg` Postgres database connector library, but other libraries offer similar features. This version is immune to injection attacks.


```javascript
const app = require("express")(),
      pg = require("pg"),
      pool = new pg.Pool(config);

app.get("search", function handler(req, res) {
  // GOOD: use parameters
  var query2 =
    "SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY=$1 ORDER BY PRICE";
  pool.query(query2, [req.params.category], function(err, results) {
    // process results
  });
});

```
Alternatively, we can use a library like `sqlstring` to escape the user input before embedding it into the query string:


```javascript
const app = require("express")(),
      pg = require("pg"),
      SqlString = require('sqlstring'),
      pool = new pg.Pool(config);

app.get("search", function handler(req, res) {
  // GOOD: the category is escaped using mysql.escape
  var query1 =
    "SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY='" +
    SqlString.escape(req.params.category) +
    "' ORDER BY PRICE";
  pool.query(query1, [], function(err, results) {
    // process results
  });
});

```

## Example
In the following example, an express handler attempts to delete a single document from a MongoDB collection. The document to be deleted is identified by its `_id` field, which is constructed from user input. The user input may contain a query object, so this code is vulnerable to a NoSQL injection attack.


```javascript
const express = require("express");
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const Todo = mongoose.model(
  "Todo",
  new mongoose.Schema({ text: { type: String } }, { timestamps: true })
);

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

app.delete("/api/delete", async (req, res) => {
  let id = req.body.id;

  await Todo.deleteOne({ _id: id }); // BAD: id might be an object with special properties

  res.json({ status: "ok" });
});

```
To fix this vulnerability, we can use the `$eq` operator to ensure that the user input is interpreted as a literal value and not as a query object:


```javascript
app.delete("/api/delete", async (req, res) => {
  let id = req.body.id;
  await Todo.deleteOne({ _id: { $eq: id } }); // GOOD: using $eq operator for the comparison

  res.json({ status: "ok" });
});
```
Alternatively check that the user input is a literal value and not a query object before using it:


```javascript
app.delete("/api/delete", async (req, res) => {
  let id = req.body.id;
  if (typeof id !== "string") {
    res.status(400).json({ status: "error" });
    return;
  }
  await Todo.deleteOne({ _id: id }); // GOOD: id is guaranteed to be a string

  res.json({ status: "ok" });
});

```
