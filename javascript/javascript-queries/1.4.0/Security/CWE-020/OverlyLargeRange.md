# Overly permissive regular expression range
It's easy to write a regular expression range that matches a wider range of characters than you intended. For example, `/[a-zA-z]/` matches all lowercase and all uppercase letters, as you would expect, but it also matches the characters: `` [ \ ] ^ _ ` ``.

Another common problem is failing to escape the dash character in a regular expression. An unescaped dash is interpreted as part of a range. For example, in the character class `[a-zA-Z0-9%=.,-_]` the last character range matches the 55 characters between `,` and `_` (both included), which overlaps with the range `[0-9]` and is clearly not intended by the writer.


## Recommendation
Avoid any confusion about which characters are included in the range by writing unambiguous regular expressions. Always check that character ranges match only the expected characters.


## Example
The following example code is intended to check whether a string is a valid 6 digit hex color.

```javascript

function isValidHexColor(color) {
    return /^#[0-9a-fA-f]{6}$/i.test(color);
}

```
However, the `A-f` range is overly large and matches every uppercase character. It would parse a "color" like `#XXYYZZ` as valid.

The fix is to use an uppercase `A-F` range instead.

```javascript

function isValidHexColor(color) {
    return /^#[0-9A-F]{6}$/i.test(color);
}

```
